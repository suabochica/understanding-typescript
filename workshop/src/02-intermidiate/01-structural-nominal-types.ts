/**
 * Structural Nominal Types
 * ========================
 *
 * Typescript is a structural type system. That just mean it will lok at a type
 * and determine all properties it has and if an another type has the same properties
 * it will be treated as the _same_ type. The opposite would be a nominal type system,
 * like haskell, where the name of the type will be taken into account to decide if a
 * type is compatible or not with another
