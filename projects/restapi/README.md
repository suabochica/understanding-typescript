REST API
=======

Let's build a REST API with node.js, typescript and express.

🥅 Goal
-------

Let's build a web application where we can enter an address, then I want to look at this address and convert it into a pair of coordinates with help of Google's APIs. This coordinate will shown on a map with help of Google Maps JavaScript SDK.

👨🏾‍💻 Dev env
-------------

It is recommended run two processes in two different terminals:

1. `tsc -w`: to enable the typescript compiler in watch mode, and, update the contents inside `dist` folder
2. `npm start`: to run the local server with nodemon.
