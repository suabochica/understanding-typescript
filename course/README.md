# Understanding TypeScript

Most People know TypeScript from Angular 2. It's the Language you have to use there, right?

It's more than that!

Learn what TypeScript is, why it really is a powerful Addition to JavaScript, what its Features are and how to use it! And whilst doing so, also understand what you're actually doing in your Angular 2 Code.

This Course takes you from the very Basics and its most important Feature (Types!) to the Point where you're able to use TypeScript in any of your Projects. ReactJS Projects included!

As TypeScript is developed by Microsoft and strongly advertised used by Angular 2 (Google), it's here to stay.

Gain an Edge today and be amongst the First to really understand TypeScript!

## A Journey into the Future

As TypeScript code can be compiled to ES5, you'll be amazed by the many next-gen Features you can start using Today. Be it ES6 Features like Destructuring or Arrow Functions, Decorators, Generics and Interfaces or Modules - TypeScript has them all!

In this Course, we'll not stop after the Basics. You will learn about more advanced Features and also how to set up Workflows with TypeScript. This includes a TypeScript-only Workflow as well as Workflows using Gulp or Webpack.

You'll also learn that you're not limited to Angular 2 or plain JavaScript/ TypeScript Projects. A complete Module covers how to use TypeScript with ReactJS to benefit from its Features, there, too.

## Practice what you Learn

Watching Videos is a great Way to Learn. And to a lot of Students, it's the best Way. If you also want to practice the Things you learn, this Course offers you Exercises (and Solutions) in many of the Course Modules.
